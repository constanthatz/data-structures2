A collection of data structure implementations in python.

## Structures
* Binary Search Tree - Stores keys in sorted order, where each left child is less than it's parent and each right child is greater than it. Values already found in the tree are not re-added. Includes insert, contains, size, depth, balance, and delete methods. Includes four traversal methods: in order, pre-order, post-order, and breadth first.
